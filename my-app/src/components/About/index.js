    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Full-stack web developer leveraging sales background to build a more user-friendly experience on the web. Recently earned a certificate in full stack development from Georgia Tech University, with newly developed skills in creating responsive web designs. I consider myself a problem solver able to clearly define the issue & offer solutions. My passion for creating user-friendly experiences both with the UI and back-end functionality comes from my time in sales and hearing my customers challenges. During my time as an Account Executive I was awarded Rookie of the Year in Sales for and yearly profits for my branch are on pace for over 1 million dollars. The efficiencies gained through user-friendly tools that enhance productivity are applicable to every industry. I am excited to leverage the insight I have gained in sales with the knowledge in web development to help the internet be more accessible to businesses in all industries.
